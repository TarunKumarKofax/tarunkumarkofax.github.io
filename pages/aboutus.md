## SOLUTIONS   {#formats}

### Accounts Payable Automation
With fluctuating volumes of invoices arriving in every possible format, manual keying of data into systems and inefficient approval workflows, the probability of errors, lost documents and non-compliance is high. Fortunately, the benefits of Accounts Payable automation are proven and documented for companies small and large. Major reductions in invoice processing cycle times and costs, near total visibility into documentation and metrics and seamless ERP integration are creating hyper-efficient Accounts Payable departments that are also strategic hubs of business intelligence.

### Digital Mailroom
Automate the collection, extraction and validation of incoming information and distribute to business process workflows. Organizations receive a high volume of varying document types from a wide range of channels that launch or continue internal business processes. Many do not have standard processes or capabilities in place to automate the collection and processing of documents, relying on expensive, error prone manual processes to scan, extract and enter data.

Getting data capture right across every channel and making data available quickly, accurately and in context enables better customer service, improved efficiency, reduced costs and simplified compliance.Creating not just digital transformation, but true business transformation. Deploy digital mailroom automation software comprising capture and business process management technology to automatically extract and validate information from incoming business mail (paper and electronic formats and channels) and convert it to structured electronic information that feeds business processes and systems across the enterprise.
